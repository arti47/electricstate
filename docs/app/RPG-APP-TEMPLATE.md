# RPG Player-Character App — Autonomous Build Instructions (v3)

> **To the AI receiving this file:** you have been given (1) this document and (2) a
> tabletop RPG rulebook in some form. Your task is to build a complete, installable
> player-character app for that game by executing the procedure below. The document is
> self-contained: the user does not fill anything in. **You** extract every game-specific
> fact from the rulebook, complete **one checkpoint + a short product Q&A**, then build
> the entire app autonomously.
>
> **Execution order:**
> 1. **Stage A — Ingest & Extract (§2, §3):** read the rulebook systematically and complete
>    the System Profile. Never substitute training-data memory for the rulebook.
> 2. **Stage B — Checkpoint + Product Q&A (§4):** present the System Profile summary,
>    content inventory, proposals, and ambiguity rulings for sign-off (**B.1**), then ask
>    the standard product-decision questions **one at a time** (**B.2**).
> 3. **Stage C — Build (§5–§9):** instantiate the project CLAUDE.md (including the **Data
>    Extraction Ledger**, §9.1) and build phase by phase, autonomously, under the process
>    rules in §10. After Stage B, ask the user questions **only** when the rulebook is
>    genuinely ambiguous on a rules point.
> 4. **Stage D — Audit to done (§11):** run the audit protocol until a full pass finds
>    nothing. This is not optional polish; in the reference builds it produced more than
>    half of the app's correctness.
>
> Everything marked **LOCKED** is proven architecture from fully built and rules-audited
> reference implementations — do not substitute or "improve" it.
> Everything marked **CONDITIONAL** is included only when the game actually has that
> subsystem; if the game lacks it, omit it entirely — never invent mechanics.

## 0. The one thing that goes wrong

Across reference builds, one defect class outnumbers every other combined:

> **Data is extracted faithfully, unit-tested, documented in the UI — and never called.**

A talent's effect sits in `data.js`. The sheet prints its name. The roller never reads it.
Everything looks finished and the rule does nothing. The same shape recurs as: a toggle that
sets a flag nothing reads; a constant imported and unused; a state field written and never
consumed; a modal that explains a cost the engine never charges.

Reading the code does not find these — you read the sentence in the UI and believe it.
**Mechanical scans find them in a minute** (§11.1). Build the scans early and run them every
pass. Everything else in this document is downstream of that lesson.

---

## 1. What you are building

| | |
|---|---|
| **Game** | The RPG in the supplied rulebook — core rules only (no setting/adventure content) |
| **Audience** | Players (player-facing tool with an opt-in GM screen — not a GM-first tool) |
| **Platforms** | Phone, browser, desktop — one installable PWA |
| **Core job** | Character **creation wizard** + full in-play **tracker** + native **dice engine** |
| **Multiplayer** | **Local-first by default**: single-device experience is built and playtested first; real-time shared party & combat sync is architected from day one but its build phase is gated behind the First Session Playable milestone (§9). The Stage B Q&A can promote it to the critical path. |
| **Backend** | Firebase Realtime Database + Storage; offline-capable; runs with no keys in local mode |
| **Theme** | Visual identity evoking the game's genre and trade-dress (proposed at checkpoint); light + dark, **default follows system** (`prefers-color-scheme`), in-app toggle overrides |

**Mandatory scope (every app, every game):** creation wizard · full in-play character
sheet · native dice engine · inventory & resources · **persistent resource/currency header
on every in-play screen** · **roll log** (every roll recorded with enough detail to
re-derive it, attributed to whoever rolled, filterable; `aria-live` announced) · **JSON
export/import backup** in Settings · **scene/session lifecycle engine** (the app owns
boundary events, with confirmation summary + one-step undo) · searchable rules library
(**every automated surface links to its rules-library entry**) · **per-screen "what this
does" note** (§6.6) · **first-session tutorial** (§6.6) · bestiary/NPC compendium · Firebase
multiplayer party with shared combat tracker (gated per above) · GM screen.
**Conditional:** solo mode (only if official solo rules exist) · expansion content (only
if expansion books are supplied; commitment tiers set at Stage B) · power/spell automation
(only if the game has such a subsystem) · shared group entity (only if the game has one —
§3.8).

---

## 2. Stage A — Rulebook ingestion

The rulebook may arrive in any form. Adapt:

- **PDF file(s):** read systematically cover-to-cover for the System Profile (skim
  fiction/setting chapters; read rules chapters closely). Record page numbers as you
  extract; cite them in data-file comments so the audit (§11) can re-check values fast.
- **Plain-text transcription of a PDF:** the most common real case, and the most dangerous.
  Transcription **de-interleaves multi-column tables**: a weapons table becomes a vertical
  list of names, then a vertical list of bonuses, then a vertical list of damages, with no
  reliable way to re-pair them. See §2.1.
- **Queryable notebook (e.g. NotebookLM):** first map the book's structure (query for the
  table of contents / chapter list), then extract section by section. Notebook answers are
  non-deterministic — corroborate any surprising value with a second, differently-phrased
  query before recording it. **A first-pass answer that summarizes a procedure is not the
  procedure** — for anything sequential (opposed tests, death, task resolution), ask for
  the EXACT step-by-step rule including edge cases (ties, who acts first, who banks
  leftover resources).
- **SRD / website URL:** crawl the section index first, then extract per section. Note
  that SRDs often omit content from the full book — tell the user at the checkpoint what
  the SRD does not cover.
- **Pasted text:** treat as authoritative for what it contains; list at the checkpoint
  everything the §3 profile needs that the text does not cover, and ask for those pages.
- **No digital source at all:** fall back to interviewing the user — walk the §3 slots in
  order, **one question at a time**, and record their answers as the source of record
  (flag at the checkpoint that values are user-supplied and unverified against a printing).

### 2.1 Source precedence and corrupted tables — **LOCKED**

Establish this order in the project CLAUDE.md on day one and never deviate:

> **page images > official character sheet > transcript/OCR text > third-party summary**

- A **third-party summary corroborates; it never decides.** Where transcript and summary
  disagree, request the page image rather than picking one. Where the summary is the *only*
  source for a value, mark the value provisional in the data file.
- **Never reconstruct a de-interleaved table from the transcript alone.** If a table's
  columns have been flattened into separate lists, the row alignment is unrecoverable and
  a plausible-looking reconstruction is worse than a blocked feature. Ask for a photo of
  the page. Record the block in a `TRANSCRIPT-ISSUES.md` alongside chapter line offsets,
  and **build no UI against a blocked table.**
- **Printed derived values lose to formulas.** Published pregens and sample characters
  contain arithmetic errors. When a pregen's printed Health disagrees with the game's own
  formula, the formula wins, and the discrepancy is recorded as a named erratum constant
  (`PREGEN_ERRATA`) with the page cited — never silently "corrected" and never silently
  copied. A regression test asserts the formula for every pregen and the erratum list for
  the exceptions.
- **Cite by line number, not page number**, when working from a transcript: page numbers
  survive in the text but drift against the real printing.

**Hard rules for extraction, regardless of form:**
- Every number, list, table, formula, and procedure in the app comes **from the supplied
  source**. If you cannot find a value, ask for it or mark the feature blocked — never
  fill gaps from memory of the game, even if you know it well. (Your memory of a game and
  its current printing routinely disagree; the printing wins.)
- **Extraction is complete, not sampled.** All spells, all monsters, all gear, all
  talents/feats in the core book go into the data files — the app is not done until the
  core book's every list is fully represented. For very large books, plan multiple
  data-extraction phases in the roadmap (§9), but completeness is non-negotiable.
- **Extract the guidance, not just the tables.** Solo principles, GM pacing advice, safety
  tools, "how to build a threat" checklists and per-archetype suggestions are content the
  app should surface. In reference builds these were extracted and then never shown — the
  same defect as §0, wearing a different coat.
- **Rules live in appendices, sidebars and stat blocks too.** A single guard-dog stat block
  in a bestiary appendix, a "minor NPCs use 2 in everything" line in a margin, a safety
  note before a table — these are rules with no chapter of their own and they are the ones
  a chapter-by-chapter sweep misses. Read the boxed text.
- **A permission the book grants is a feature.** "You may create a new talent", "you may
  reduce this alone", "either side may declare it over" — permissions read like flavour and
  are mechanics. Each one needs a control. If the app can only do the thing the book
  presents as the default path, it has quietly removed a rule.
- **Multiple books supplied:** the core rulebook populates `data.js`; each additional
  official book becomes its own `data-<name>.js` behind a content toggle, off by default
  (§8). The Stage B Q&A assigns each book a **commitment tier** (committed / stretch /
  dropped). Errata/revised versions of core content are canonical everywhere regardless
  of toggle.
- **Paraphrase, don't copy.** Extract numbers and mechanics; rewrite all effect and flavor
  text concisely in your own words. Never reproduce rules prose verbatim. Exclude setting,
  adventure, and art content entirely (see §12).

### 2.2 House aids — **LOCKED** if you build any

The book will be missing a table the book itself references, or one the app obviously needs
(name generators, a starting-point table for a journey). You may invent it, under rules:

- It lives in its **own file** (`data-<topic>.js`), never mixed into extracted data.
- It exports a `HOUSE_AID = true` flag and **the UI labels it as a house aid** wherever it
  is rolled.
- It contains **no setting content** — describe things by what they are, never by named
  places, people or brands from the setting.
- If it is an oracle/interpretation table, follow one published method and cite it; note
  in the project CLAUDE.md the distinction between **meaning tables** (single words, feed
  interpretation, keep doubles as amplification) and **content tables** (hand over a
  finished thing, draw distinct rows). Mixing the two produces tables that do neither job.

---

## 3. Stage A — System Profile to extract

Complete every slot below from the rulebook. The **archetype examples** exist so you map
unfamiliar systems honestly instead of forcing them into another game's shape — identify
which archetype (or novel shape) the game actually is, per slot.

**3.1 Core resolution mechanic.** The dice mechanic, success criteria, crit/fumble rules,
modifier model, the advantage mechanism, and the push/re-roll economy (with its costs and
legality limits) if one exists. **Flag every rule that repeats itself** — "on a hit you may
fire again", "if that fails, roll again at +2", "further damage restarts the count". These
cascade rules are implemented as single shots by default and the repetition is silently
lost; each one needs an explicit loop with its own termination condition and cap.
*Archetypes:* roll-under d20/d100 (Call of Cthulhu, RuneQuest — natural extremes
crit/fumble; advantage = roll extra dice, keep best/worst); d20+modifier vs DC
(D&D/Pathfinder — advantage = 2d20-keep, scaling proficiency); 2d6+stat tiered outcomes
(PbtA — 10+/7–9/6−, moves carry outcome text, no GM rolls); dice pool counting successes
(Year Zero/WoD/Blades — push with a cost, complications on specific faces); 2d20 target
number (Modiphius — pool 2–5 d20s, roll under skill+attribute, buy dice with
meta-currency, no push but a spendable conviction resource).

**3.2 Opposed / contested test procedure.** The EXACT sequence when two characters roll
against each other: who rolls first, whether one side's result sets the other's target,
the tie rule, and who banks leftover resources on a win or loss. Do not summarize this
slot from a general description — first-pass extraction routinely gets opposed tests
wrong. *Archetypes:* simultaneous roll-and-compare (highest margin wins); defender-first
(defender's successes become the attacker's difficulty; tie often favors the active
character); static defense (defender contributes a number, never rolls).

**3.3 Meta-currencies & shared pools.** Every table-level or character-level currency
outside the character's printed stats: name, who holds it (personal / group-shared / GM
mirror), how it is earned, **every legal spend with exact cost**, the **pool cap**, and
any **decay/reset schedule** (per scene, session, adventure). The GM's mirror economy (if
one exists) is extracted with the same rigor. *Archetypes:* Momentum/Threat (2d20);
Fate/Fortune points; Bennies; Inspiration; Stress/Trauma as spendable; Darkness Points.

**3.3a Currency interactions and lose conditions.** Where two tracked numbers are compared
to produce a state (addiction ≥ willpower, corruption ≥ humanity, stress ≥ composure),
record the comparison as a first-class rule. These are the game's real stakes, they belong
in the persistent header, and their **resolution paths** (who can end the state, at what
cost, and any once-per talent that grants an escape roll) are part of the slot.

**3.4 Attributes & scales.** Attribute list, value ranges, and every legal generation
method (rolled, array, point-buy, playbook-fixed) with its exact procedure. Note: some
games have **no classic attributes** (skill+drive, approach-based, playbook-only) — record
the real shape, and note that two §3 slots may merge when the game genuinely fuses them.

**3.5 Derived stats.** Every derived value and its **exact formula including rounding** —
HP/wounds, defenses, speed, carry limit, damage bonuses, initiative, saves, resource
maxima. These formulas drive the wizard and the sheet; they live in the data layer or a
pure rules module, never inline in UI code. If the game derives almost nothing (target
number = stat A + stat B and that's all), record that explicitly — a near-empty slot is a
valid, load-bearing finding.

**3.6 Skills / proficiencies.** The full list with governing attributes, trained/untrained
rules, and value derivation. If the game has no skill list, this slot is the move list /
action-rating list instead. Include specialization mechanisms (focuses, specialties,
expert dice) and exactly what they change (crit range, extra dice, re-rolls).

**3.7 Creation options.** Every choice character creation offers, in rule-legal order —
species/ancestry (+ innate abilities), class/profession/playbook (+ starting skills, gear,
features), faction/template picks (+ mandatory selections), age/background/experience
tiers (+ modifiers), starting power/feat picks. For each: what it grants, what it
constrains, what makes the result legal. **Record the creation steps that happen after the
character sheet is full** — the party's shared entity, the destination, the relationships
between characters. They are the ones every implementation forgets (§6.3.7, "the next step is named").

**3.8 Shared group entity — CONDITIONAL.** If the game has a party-level entity (noble
House, crew, ship, warband, covenant, colony, caravan): its **own creation wizard** (steps,
stat arrays, domain/asset choices), its stats and resources, how characters interact with
it mechanically (roles, using its stats in tests, spending its wealth), and **who may edit
it in play**. In multiplayer it is campaign-level shared state, not a character field.
*Archetypes:* Dune House (skill arrays by tier, domains → wealth); Blades crew (playbook,
rep, turf); Traveller ship (mortgage, roles); Ars Magica covenant.

**3.9 Conditions & statuses.** The condition list, causes, exact mechanical effects, and
removal rules. In the app, a condition **auto-applies** its effect to the rolls it touches
— a checkbox with no mechanical teeth is not done. Record **conditions that rewrite the
engine's own rules** (cannot push / must push / cannot be healed by X / cannot benefit
from the group) separately from dice modifiers: these need machine-readable rule keys, a
documented **conflict-resolution order** when two contradict, and their own tests. If the
game has no fixed list (complications create ad-hoc negative traits), record the
trait-creation and removal economy instead.

**3.10 Health, damage & death.** The damage model (HP, wound levels, harm/stress tracks,
**or defeat/progress tracks with no HP at all**), armor/soak (or difficulty-based defense),
and the **exact dying/death procedure** step by step, including every escape hatch
(resist-defeat, death saves, trauma-out) and its once-per-X limits. The death procedure
gets a dedicated guided UI — it is the highest-stakes moment in play and must be
impossible to run wrong. **Record what happens on each terminal outcome**: surviving often
triggers a lasting-injury roll, dying often triggers a new character. Both are part of the
procedure and both get an onward route in the UI (§6.3.6).

**3.10a Archetype exceptions to the damage model — CONDITIONAL.** Some games publish a
class that takes damage under different rules entirely (a machine body, an incorporeal
being, a possessing spirit). Extract every exception it makes to §3.10, §3.11 and §3.16 as
a named rule set, and note that the app must branch on it everywhere — the vitals label,
the death procedure, rest, injuries, inventory, currency. Reference builds have shipped
this archetype as flesh-and-blood four separate times before catching it.

**3.11 Rest & recovery.** Each rest type, duration, what it restores, and its usage
limits. Once-per-X limits are rules — the app enforces them. Include recovery of
narrative resources (crossed-out beliefs/drives, stress, corruption), not just physical
wounds, and record **what blocks recovery** (hunger, cold, disease, sleeplessness) — those
blockers imply background procedures the lifecycle engine must actually run (§3.12).

**3.12 Scene / session / adventure lifecycle.** What the game defines as a scene, session,
downtime, and adventure — and **exactly what happens at each boundary**: pool decay,
temporary asset/effect expiry, per-scene flags resetting, start-of-adventure resource
resets, end-of-session XP procedures. **The app owns these events**: explicit End
Scene / End Session / End Adventure controls that fire the whole bundle, with a
confirmation summary and one-step undo. Also record the **environmental checks that run on
a boundary** (exposure, starvation, thirst, sleep, disease progression, addiction decay);
each is a roll the app makes, not a note the player reads. If the game has no such
structure, record that.

**3.13 Extended / progress tasks.** The game's mechanism for efforts spanning multiple
rolls: extended tests, skill challenges, progress clocks, research projects. The exact
procedure — what a roll contributes, what modifies contribution, complication effects,
multiple contributors — and everything in the book that runs on it (death tracks, healing,
crafting, journeys). Build **one generic tracker component** reused by all of them.

**3.14 Powers / magic / special abilities — CONDITIONAL.** Power lists by school/class/
sphere, the activation roll, resource costs, boost/upcast options, failure/mishap tables,
preparation rules, restrictions (e.g. armor prohibitions), and any power subsystems
(summons, familiars, crafting, corruption). The bar is "tap to cast": activating a power
deducts its cost, rolls the right check, and resolves crits/mishaps from the game's real
tables. **If powers are implemented as talents/feats with embedded mechanics rather than
a subsystem, there is no separate power module — but every talent with a dice effect must
still be automated in the roller ("tap to use"), never merely displayed.**

**3.14a Abilities that change a rule rather than a die count.** Classify every ability as
`dice` (adds/removes dice — the roller wires these naturally) or `rule` (changes what is
legal, substitutes one attribute for another, grants an extra roll, alters a cost). **The
`rule` ones are the ones that ship inert**, because nothing in the roller needs them to
compile. Each requires: a machine-readable key, a named home in a specific module, and a
test asserting it fires. Include the game's permission to **invent** an ability if it
grants one — that is a feature, not flavour text.

**3.15 Advancement.** The exact advancement loop — XP thresholds, marks-and-session-end
procedures, milestones, playbook advances, **cost formulas and any one-advance-per-X
gates** — plus identity mechanics that interact with it (weakness/drive/bond/ambition).
Automate earning, spending/rolling, and consequences (new features at thresholds), and
carry the ability descriptions into the picker: a list of forty bare names is not a
choice.

**3.16 Inventory, encumbrance & wealth.** The game's *actual* carrying model (slots,
weight, abstract load, **or abstract assets with a permanent-asset cap**), equipped-gear
exemptions, currency denominations and coin weight (or an abstract wealth index and its
price ladder), stackables, durability/quality ratings. Over-limit consequences are
enforced, not just warned. Record the **repair path** for anything that degrades — a
degradable item with no way back is a dead end the audit will find later.

**3.17 Combat structure.** Initiative method (cards, rolls, side-based, popcorn,
alternating with seize/keep-initiative economics), the action economy per turn, movement
rules (grid, zones — physical or abstract), reactions (parry/dodge/opportunity) **and what
a reaction costs**, monster/NPC activation rules including multi-attack/ferocity, and
**whether multiple conflict scales share one engine** (dueling/skirmish/warfare; social
conflict as combat). Include any dual play scale (personal vs organization-level actions,
physical vs virtual realm) and what stats each scale uses, plus what happens to a character
who is acting in the other scale when attacked.

**3.18 Bestiary & NPCs.** Every monster/adversary stat block in the book, including
attack tables and attacks-per-turn; NPC archetypes; animals; **the NPC tier system**
(minion/notable/major build recipes) if one exists; which creatures are deliberately
unstatted forces of nature (record the fact — do not invent stats). Animals and minor
NPCs are stat blocks too: they belong in the same lookup the combat tracker uses, or they
will be extracted and unreachable.

**3.19 Pre-generated characters — CONDITIONAL.** If the book publishes pregens — or
sanctions playing its iconic NPCs — extract them fully for one-tap instantiation, and
record which rules economy they run on (PC rules vs NPC rules) as a checkpoint ruling.
Validate every printed derived value against §3.5 (see §2.1 on errata).

**3.20 Solo rules — CONDITIONAL.** Official solo oracle/tables/procedures only. If the
book has none, there is no solo tab — do not invent one. Extract the solo chapter's
**procedural framing** as well as its tables: how many characters the mode assumes, whether
a spotlight rotates between them, what the pacing device is (a deck, a clock, a countdown)
and the rule that governs when it resets.

**3.21 GM tables.** Fumble tables, fear/horror tables, random encounters, travel mishaps,
story/adventure generators, enemy generators — whatever rollable tables the book gives a
GM; these power the GM screen's reference panel.

**3.22 Safety tools.** Whatever the book recommends (lines and veils, an X-card, a debrief,
consent around specific content) and any rules the book explicitly gates behind table
agreement. These belong in Settings, before play, next to the toggle for the gated rules —
not in a document nobody opens.

## 4. Stage B — Checkpoint + Product Q&A

### 4.1 The Checkpoint (one sign-off)

Before writing any application code, present a single, readable summary containing:

1. **System Profile digest** — each §3 slot in 1–3 sentences with the key numbers (e.g.
   "Resolution: roll-under d20 vs skill; nat 1 crit / nat 20 fumble; boons/banes =
   extra d20 keep best/worst; push = re-roll once, take a condition").
2. **Content inventory** — counts per category (skills, powers, monsters, gear, pregens…)
   so the user sees the extraction scale, plus anything the source did not cover.
3. **Blocked data** — every table you could not recover (§2.1), what you need to unblock it
   (usually a photo of one page), and which features are held back until then.
4. **Proposals** (defaults below — present your concrete choices):
   - **App name:** default `<Game> Player`.
   - **Visual theme:** a palette/typography direction that evokes the game's genre and
     trade-dress **without copying its art or logos** (parchment/ink for a fantasy game,
     terminal-green for cyberpunk, etc.); light/dark with system-default.
   - **Rules-vs-setting boundary:** which chapters you are including vs excluding.
   - **Expansions detected** with proposed commitment tiers; **solo mode** present or
     absent; **group entity** present or absent.
5. **Ambiguity list** — every rules point where the book was unclear, with your proposed
   ruling for each. The user confirms or corrects; rulings get recorded in the project
   CLAUDE.md with a stable ruling id (`A1`, `A2`…) so later work can cite them.

### 4.2 The Product Q&A (standard, one question at a time)

After checkpoint sign-off, ask these **one at a time** (adapt wording to the game; skip
any the user already answered; add game-specific levers you discovered). Record all
answers as **§1.1 Product Decisions** in the project CLAUDE.md, and instantiate the
roadmap to match:

1. **Usage mode** — full shared campaign / local-first with sync later (default) /
   single-device only. Sets Phase 5's gate.
2. **User's seat** — GM / player / rotates. Sets GM-screen priority.
3. **Dice input** — digital-only / digital + manual physical-dice entry / manual-first.
   Shapes the roller. (Manual entry is **two-stage** for any push economy: enter the
   initial dice, then only the re-rolled ones. A single total cannot tell the engine what
   the push cost.)
4. **Expansion commitment** — which supplied books are committed vs stretch vs dropped.
5. **Table device** — phone / tablet / desktop / mixed. Tunes layout effort (baseline
   stays phone-first regardless).
6. **Theme default** — follow system (default) / always dark / always light.

After the Q&A, build autonomously to completion. Ask further questions **only** for
newly discovered rules ambiguities — never for permission to continue.

---

## 5. Architecture — **LOCKED**

- **No build step.** Vanilla JS, native ES modules loaded directly by the browser
  (`<script type="module" src="src/main.js">`). Clone-and-run must always work.
- **Installable PWA:** `manifest.json`, `service-worker.js` (network-first, caches the app
  shell + all data files, versioned `CACHE_VERSION`), an SVG icon, and an in-app
  "Update available — reload" toast when the service worker detects new code.
- **Storage modes:** `localStorage` **local-only mode** works with zero configuration;
  dropping real keys into `firebase-config.js` (clearly marked placeholder block +
  `FIREBASE_ENABLED` flag) switches on cloud sync. Never commit real keys.
- **Firebase:** Realtime Database (bandwidth-priced, low-latency — right for hundreds of
  tiny HP/condition writes) + Storage for portraits (client-side canvas compression to
  ~400px before upload).
- **Auth:** instant anonymous launch, no login wall; optional Google account linking in
  Settings for cross-device backup.
- **Roles from day one:** `members/{uid}.role: "player" | "gm"` in the schema **and** in
  `database.rules.json` (players read/write own sheet + shared combat; GM reads/writes
  all) — so the GM screen needs zero migration. If a shared group entity exists (§3.8),
  its write rules (GM + designated role) are in the schema from day one too.
- **Campaigns:** memorable fantasy-phrase join codes (e.g. `red-dragon-sword`).
- **Themed UI primitives:** no native `alert/confirm/prompt` — a shared `modal()` +
  `showToast/confirmModal/promptModal`, accessible (focus trap, Escape, `aria-modal`,
  focus restore) and sized to the visual viewport (mobile-toolbar safe). **Modal actions
  are ordered primary-first, consistently, everywhere.**
- **Null-safe DOM helpers.** The element factory skips nullish children so
  `el("div", {}, maybe && node)` is safe. Provide a matching `add(parent, ...children)`
  helper and use it for **every** append of a value that can be null — a bare
  `node.append(null)` renders the literal text `null` into the page (§13, D-1).
- **Accessibility:** keyboard + screen-reader usable — `aria-live` roll results and
  vitals, labeled icon-only buttons (**including checkboxes**, which the layout harness
  measures), `aria-current` nav.
- **Responsive:** phone-first; zero horizontal overflow at 320, 360 and 390px on every
  screen, in a realistic mid-campaign state (§11.2.6).

| `CLAUDE.md` | This document, instantiated (§9) — the project's living canonical spec |
| `docs/rules/` | Distilled per-subsystem reference, one file per chapter — the audit reads these against the engine (§11.2) |
| `docs/AUDIT.md` | Numbered findings, pass by pass, with the verified-clean list |

### 6.1 `src/` module map — **LOCKED** responsibilities

One module per responsibility; explicit `import`/`export`, nothing smuggled through
`window`. Runtime cycles (sheet ↔ roller ↔ combat) are safe under ESM live bindings.

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `core.js` | Foundational constants, DOM/util helpers (incl. the null-safe `add`), raw dice functions. No imports. |
| `ui.js` | Themed modals/toasts/confirm/prompt, the collapsible **explain()** note (§6.6), and the pinned **actionBar()** (§6.2). |
| `rules.js` | Pure rules lookups over the data libraries. Lookups that can resolve a **character-owned** entry (an invented ability) take the character as an optional second argument. |
| `derived.js` | Character-derived calculations (effective maxima, encumbrance, equipped gear, condition modifiers, rule-conflict resolution, data normalization/migration). |
| `settings.js` | Feature/content toggles (expansions, solo, GM screen, advanced automation). |
| `store.js` | Local/cloud character (+ group entity) persistence + combat mirroring + JSON export/import + the roll log (attributed at write time). |
| `sync.js` | Firebase auth, campaigns, join codes, presence + theme. |
| `wizard.js` | Creation wizard (+ group-entity wizard, §3.8) + pregens. |
| `roller.js` | The dice engine: every roll type, opposed-test sequence (§3.2), meta-currency spends (§3.3), push flows, ability-embedded automation, damage applier, **roll-log writes**. |
| `sheet.js` | The full character sheet + all in-play tracking UI + persistent resource header. |
| `combat.js` | Shared combat tracker: initiative, turn state, turn-order derivation, combatant cards, generic progress-task tracker (§3.13). |
| `lifecycle.js` | Scene/session/adventure boundaries (§3.12), rest, environmental checks, advancement debrief (§3.15). |
| `power-automation.js` | Automated power/spell resolution — CONDITIONAL on §3.14 being a true subsystem. |
| `solo.js` | Solo assistant — CONDITIONAL on §3.20. |
| `gm.js` | GM dashboard. |
| `screens.js` | Top-level screen renderers (home/rules/settings) + roll-log view. |
| `tutorial.js` | First-session walkthrough. |
| `router.js` | Bottom-nav routing, **section nav** (§6.3.1), conditional tab gating. |
| `main.js` | Entry point / boot. |

When adding or moving a `src/` file: update the project CLAUDE.md's file tables **and**
the service-worker app-shell list, then bump `CACHE_VERSION` — in the same change.

### 6.2 Screen anatomy — **LOCKED**

Design for the real situation: a phone held in one hand, at arm's length, on a dim table,
by someone mid-conversation who has three seconds of attention to spare. Everything below
follows from that.

Every screen sits inside the same frame. Four regions are fixed; only one scrolls.

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ app header  (brand · theme)  │  sticky, ~52px
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ resource header (vitals)     │  sticky under it, shown on in-play screens
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ section nav  (pill row)      │  first thing inside the scroll area
│                              │
│ screen content  ← scrolls    │
│                              │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ action bar  (primary action) │  fixed above the tab bar, when the screen has one
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ tab bar  (4–6 tabs)          │  fixed, safe-area padded
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

**The contract:**
- The body carries bottom padding of `tab-bar height + safe-area + gap`, so the last
  control is never half-hidden. The action bar adds its own **spacer element**, returned
  together with the bar by one helper so a caller cannot forget it.
- The resource header is **sticky under the app header**, not part of the scroll: the two
  or three numbers that decide every choice in the game stay visible while you read
  anything else. It follows whoever is currently in context — the Traveler whose sheet is
  open, or the one selected on the dice screen.
- **Colour is reserved for meaning.** Pick one palette family for the game's mood and spend
  colour only on semantics: one hue for damage and loss, one for the game's signature
  resource, danger states also carrying text so colour is never the sole channel.
- **Zoom is off** (`user-scalable=no`, `maximum-scale=1`, `touch-action: manipulation`) and
  every input is ≥16px so mobile browsers do not zoom on focus. A stray pinch mid-roll is
  only ever a nuisance in a play aid.
- **Reduced motion honoured**; no animation carries information.

### 6.3 Placing controls — gameplay flow — **LOCKED**

Layout is a rules question, not a taste question: the app should read like the game's own
sequence of play.

1. **Two-level navigation.** The bottom tab bar holds 4–6 tabs. **Any tab that owns more
   than one route carries a section nav** — a horizontally scrolling pill row at the top of
   every screen in that group, listing its siblings and marking the current one. Without
   it, routes beyond the first are reachable only from a link buried at the foot of another
   screen; in the reference build twelve of eighteen routes were in that state. Screens you
   go *into* rather than flick between (the wizard, a character sheet) are excluded.
2. **The primary action is above the fold, always.** The one control a screen exists for —
   Roll, End Shift, Next — never sits below the viewport on a phone. Where the content is
   long, pin the action in the bar, carrying its own context: the pool size, the current
   shift and day, the step number and name. **The layout harness asserts this per screen**
   (§11.2.5).
3. **Order controls by the sequence of play, and say so.** A screen that hosts a procedure
   presents its controls in the order the book performs them, in numbered phases with a
   line each on what the phase is for — *1 Before you set out · 2 On the road · 3 Arriving ·
   4 Playing the scene · 5 Turning the screw · 6 Ending it*. An unordered row of twelve
   buttons is a reference card, not a play aid. Phases used once (prep, wrap-up) fold away;
   the ones used every scene stay open.
4. **Frequency decides height.** On any screen, order blocks by how often they are touched
   in play, not by how the rulebook chapters them. On a character sheet that means: vitals,
   then the actions you take mid-scene (roll, take damage, resist), then conditions and
   gear, then the identity fields written once at creation. Reference before action is the
   most common layout mistake and the easiest to measure.
5. **In-scene before between-scene.** Within a subsystem, the rolls made during a scene
   come before the repairs, resupply and bookkeeping done between them.
6. **Every screen leads somewhere.** A screen that ends a procedure offers the next one the
   rules call for. A GM screen links to the dice and the tracker; a solo scene links to
   combat when it turns violent; a stabilized character is offered the injury roll; a dead
   one is offered the wizard. **A terminal outcome with no onward route** — a modal that
   says "you survived" and stops — leaves the player to remember a screen they have never
   opened.
7. **The next step is named.** Where the game's own procedure continues past the current
   screen (creation ends, but the party still needs a destination, a vehicle and
   relationships), the home screen names the next step until the group is ready to play.
   Otherwise a party sits looking finished with the game's Hope economy switched off.
8. **Live state travels.** State that changes what to do next — a fight in progress, a
   countdown running, a character dying — is shown wherever you are, as a badge on the
   section nav. State visible only on the screen that owns it is state nobody sees.
9. **No dead ends and no re-entry.** If tapping through to another screen is part of a
   flow (attack from the combat tracker → dice screen), the destination shows what it is
   part of and offers the way back. Never make the player re-type a number the app already
   knows.
10. **Tap targets ≥ 44px effective.** A checkbox renders at ~13px unless styled; wrap every
    option row in a `<label>` so the whole row is the target, and never let an inline style
    override the stylesheet. **The harness measures the label, not the box.**

### 6.4 Feedback and dialogs — **LOCKED**

- **Toast** for a result that needs no decision ("Repaired. Hull 4/6"). **Modal** for a
  result the player must read before continuing, or any choice. **Inline** for state that
  persists (a status note on the sheet).
- **A result dialog shows the dice, the arithmetic and the consequence** — the raw dice,
  what modified them, the outcome in the game's own language, and what the app changed as
  a result. A number with no working shown is a number the table will argue about.
- **Modal actions are ordered primary-first**, everywhere, without exception.
- **Destructive actions confirm and name the loss.** "Ending the fight discards zones,
  rounds and every Threat's remaining health" — not "Are you sure?".
- **Boundary events summarise.** Anything that fires a bundle of changes (end of scene,
  session, day) reports exactly what changed, line by line, with **one-step undo**.
- **Refusals explain the rule.** When the app blocks something, it says which rule blocked
  it: "Only a Lone wolf can settle it without the other person there", not "Not allowed".
- **Empty states point forward.** An empty screen names the thing to do and links to it.

### 6.5 Density and long screens — **LOCKED**

Test at **session-three density**, not at zero (§11.2.6). Under real load:

- Lists that grow without bound (roll logs, combatant lists, event records) **page**: show
  a session's worth, offer the rest. A hundred log entries is fifteen phone screens.
- Items that are **done** collapse to a line — a combatant who has taken their turn keeps
  their name, health and an undo, and gives up everything else.
- Reference blocks read rarely (background, notes, prep, wrap-up) **fold**.
- A screen that is legitimately long (a full character sheet) gets a **jump row** — the same
  pill component, in-page — rather than hiding content.
- **Long values stack; short values sit inline.** A flex row centres its children, so a
  two-line sentence straddles its one-line label. Inline rows for `Hope 3/5`; stacked
  definition rows (label above, value below, full width) for anything sentence-length.

### 6.6 Teaching the game — **LOCKED**

The app is many players' first contact with the system. Four layers, each with a different
job; build all four, and never let one substitute for another.

**1. `explain()` — a "what this does" note on every screen.**
- A `<details>` collapsed by default, directly under the screen's heading, so it costs
  nothing to the player who does not need it.
- **Two to four sentences, in the app's own voice**, answering: what is this surface for,
  what does the app do for me here, and what does the game charge me for it. Name the rule,
  do not quote the book.
- Written for someone who has not read the rulebook. *"Build a pool and roll it. One 6
  succeeds; extra 6s add damage. Pushing re-rolls everything that is not a 1 or a 6, and
  the app charges the Hope and gear damage that follow."*
- The harness asserts every one is present and starts collapsed.

**2. Rules-library links — the depth behind the note.**
- A searchable library, one entry per automated rule, in the app's own words, with the book
  page cited.
- **An accordion grouped by subject in session order**, collapsed until opened, with search
  that auto-opens matches — a flat scroll of forty rules is unusable at a table.
- **Every automated surface links to its entry.** A status note about death rolls links to
  the death-roll entry; the link opens that entry, expanded and scrolled to.

**3. The tutorial — a first session, step by step.**
- Its own route, linked from the home screen while no character exists and permanently from
  Settings.
- One step per thing the player must do, in play order, each saying **what to tap and why
  the game asks for it** — not what the button is called. Cover the whole first session:
  make a character, set up the group, read the sheet, make a roll, push it, take damage,
  end a scene, end the session.
- If the game has a solo mode, the tutorial covers it as a second track: what the pacing
  device is, when to draw, how to read an oracle result.
- Steps are `<details>` so the whole thing is skimmable, and the tutorial is a *screen*,
  not a modal sequence — a player returns to it mid-session.

**Voice, throughout all four layers.** The app speaks in the game's register, not in
UI-ese, and **uses the book's own names for states** — if the book says Busted, Breakdown,
Incapacitated, so does the app, so that what a player reads on screen is what the table
says out loud. Where the app must name something the book does not (a screen, a control),
name it from the fiction rather than from the interface: *Travelers*, not *Characters*;
*The Journey*, not *Campaign settings*. Empty states get the same treatment — they are the
first thing a new player reads.

**4. In-context teaching — the part that actually lands.**
- **Say why, at the moment it costs something.** When a push takes a point of Hope, the
  result says so; when a condition subtracts dice, the pool shows the condition by name.
- **Label the mechanism, not just the number.** `4 ⌊2⌋` in a Bliss tile with "Permanent
  inline" beats a second unexplained track.
- **Surface the book's own guidance where it applies** — solo principles on the solo screen,
  pacing advice and threat-building on the GM screen, safety tools in Settings before play.
- **House aids identify themselves** wherever they are rolled (§2.2).

### 6.7 The measurement contract

These are the numbers the harness enforces (§11.1). Design to them, and they never become
findings:

| Property | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Horizontal overflow | none at 320 / 360 / 390px, in stress state |
| Primary action | above the fold, no scrolling, on every screen that has one |
| Controls under the tab bar | none (excluding collapsed panels) |
| Tap target | ≥ 44px effective, measured on the wrapping label |
| Input font size | ≥ 16px |
| `explain()` note | present on every screen, collapsed by default |
| Stray `null` / `undefined` / `NaN` text | none, on any route, in any state |
| Console errors | zero, on every route |
| Screen length under stress | no unbounded list; pages or collapses |

## 7. Data model (Firebase) — **LOCKED** shape; field names follow the game

```
campaigns/{campaignId}
  meta:    { name, joinCode, createdAt, ownerUid }
  members/{uid}: { displayName, characterId, role: "player" | "gm" }
  group:   { <§3.8 group-entity shape: stats, resources, roles, traits> }  // CONDITIONAL
  pools:   { <§3.3 shared meta-currencies, with caps> }
  combat:  { active, round, initiativeOrder[]|currentSide, keptInitiative,
             pendingContest{...},                                   // if §3.2 is sequential
             combatants{ id: { ..., actedThisRound, forfeitNextTurn,
                               scale, tracks{...} } } }             // shaped by §3.17
  tasks/{taskId}: { name, requirement, progress, contributors[] }   // §3.13 generic tasks
  scenes/{sceneId}: { <§3.12 adventure/scene record, countdowns, resolved> }
  rollLog/{pushId}: { by, byId, characterName, roll inputs, dice[], outcome,
                      currencyDeltas, ts }                          // capped (~100)
  broadcast/{pushId}: { text, ts, from }                            // GM→players feed

  state:     { <§3.10 vitals/tracks>, conditions{...}, <death-procedure state>,
               <per-scene/per-session flags per §3.12>, <rest-limit flags>,
               <once-per-X escape-hatch flags per §3.3a>,
               <combat state: movement, posture, active scale per §3.17> }
  skills:    { <name>: { level/bonus, trained, mark } }             // shape per §3.6
  abilities: [ ... ]                                                // talents/feats/features
  customAbilities: [ { id, name, effect } ]                         // invented, per §3.14a
  powers:    { <§3.14 shape: known lists, cast skill, preparation> }
  inventory: { items[] (weight/qty/equipped/durability per §3.16), tiny[], money{...} }
  currencies:{ <§3.3 personal currencies, with caps> }
  companions:[ ... ]   effects:[ ... ]   notes: ""   advancementLog:[ ... ]
```

Rules: every rules number the schema references lives in the data files; every schema
addition ships with a normalization path that back-fills defaults on old characters (never
crash on old data); **state flags that represent a spent once-per-X reset in the same
normalization pass** that would restore them; every field addition is documented in the
project CLAUDE.md's data model **in the same change**.

---

## 8. Settings & toggle pattern — **LOCKED**

All optional surfaces follow one pattern: a flag in `settings.js`
(`Settings.<flag>() → !!get("<flag>")`, off by default), a toggle row in Settings & About
with a one-line description, every related UI checks the flag before rendering, and nav
tabs for gated modes are hidden by the router when off. Explicit user choice always beats
role-based defaults (store `true`/`false` distinctly from unset). A gated route reached
directly explains what it is and offers to turn it on in place — never a silent redirect.

Standard toggles: one per expansion book · solo mode · GM screen · manual dice entry ·
any rules the book gates behind table agreement (§3.22) · advanced/GM automation.

---

## 9. Build roadmap — instantiate with checkboxes in the project CLAUDE.md

At Stage C start, write the project's `CLAUDE.md`: this document's §1 and §5–§13 carried
over, **§1.1 Product Decisions** (the Stage B Q&A answers), §3 replaced by the
**completed** System Profile (with the checkpoint rulings recorded inline), the file
tables made real, the **Data Extraction Ledger** (§9.1), this roadmap instantiated with
checkboxes, and a changelog seeded with the instantiation row. That file is thereafter
the project's canonical spec, kept in sync per §10.

### 9.1 Data Extraction Ledger — mandatory

The project CLAUDE.md contains a **T-numbered checkbox ledger** listing **every data
table** the app needs, grouped by target data file and mapped to roadmap phases: every §3
list/table/formula, every catalog (talents, gear, powers, monsters), every generator
table, the rules-library quick-reference content, and per-expansion inventories. The
ledger opens with a **"How to continue"** preamble for any AI resuming the project:
work top to bottom within the current phase; query the source; corroborate surprising
values; write the table (paraphrased, cited); **tick the checkbox in the same change**
and append a changelog row; estimated counts yield to real counts (record them);
**an unticked box = data not extracted; never build UI against an unticked table.**

### 9.1a Rules Traceability Ledger — mandatory

The extraction ledger tracks whether a table exists. That is necessary and not sufficient:
in the reference build every table existed and dozens of rules still did nothing. Track the
whole path instead. **One row per rule, five columns:**

| Rule | Data | Engine | Surface | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Push: 1s on base dice cost Hope | `PUSH` | `roller.resolvePush` | Dice screen result card | `pushing keeps 1s and 6s` |
| Reacting costs your next turn | `COMBAT_REACTIONS.cost` | `combat.forfeitNextTurn` | Combatant card + opposed dialog | `a reaction costs the defender their next turn` |
| Wearing a caster: −2 real-world | `NEUROCASTERS[].realWorldPenalty` | `roller.casterDicePenalty` | Dice circumstances card | `the neurocaster costs dice only while worn` |

- **A row with a gap is the §0 defect, visible before it ships.** Data but no engine: a
  number nobody reads. Engine but no surface: a function nobody can reach. Surface but no
  test: a rule that will regress silently. No test column entry is acceptable for any rule
  the engine automates.
- Fill the row **when you build the rule**, not at audit time. The audit then becomes a
  check that the ledger is honest, which is a much cheaper thing to verify.
- Rules the app deliberately does **not** automate get a row too, with `guidance only` in
  the engine column — that is the explicit marking §10.13 requires, and it stops a later
  pass rediscovering the same non-decision.
- At the end of every phase, the dead-data scan (§11.2.1) must agree with this ledger. A
  disagreement means either the scan found something the ledger missed, or the ledger is
  describing work that was never done.

### 9.2 Phases — build strictly in order

- **Phase 0 — Foundations:** scaffold all §6 files; extract the **complete, verified**
  core data library per the ledger (multiple sub-phases for large books) — data before
  features; theme; PWA shell; app shell with router, the §6.2 frame, two-level nav (§6.3.1)
  and local storage.
- **Phase 1 — Creation Wizard(s):** the §3.7 flow with honest §3.4 generation, all §3.5
  derivations, legality validation at every step; the group-entity wizard if §3.8 exists;
  pregens if published (validated against the formulas, §2.1).
- **Phase 2 — Core Tracker:** the live sheet — vitals with steppers clamped to true
  maxima, conditions with real mechanical teeth, inventory/encumbrance, abilities/powers
  display, flavor + notes + portrait; **persistent resource header on every in-play
  screen**; **JSON export/import in Settings**; persistence + migration.
- **Phase 3 — Dice Engine:** §3.1 natively, wired into sheet skills, weapons, and powers;
  the exact §3.2 opposed sequence; §3.3 currency spends with caps enforced; condition
  effects auto-applied; push economy enforced (two-stage manual entry if chosen);
  crit/fumble consequences from the book's real tables; ability-embedded automation
  ("tap to use"); **roll log** (attributed, filterable, capped, `aria-live`); **rules
  citations** — every automated surface links to its rules-library entry.
- **🏁 Milestone — First Session Playable:** create character → live sheet → roll tests →
  track resources end-to-end, verified at (or rehearsed as) a real play session.
  **Phase 5 is gated on this milestone** unless the Stage B Q&A promoted multiplayer.
- **Phase 4 — In-Play Systems:** guided death procedure (§3.10, impossible to run wrong,
  with onward routes on every terminal outcome); rests with enforced limits; **lifecycle
  engine (§3.12) with confirmation summary + one-step undo**, including the environmental
  checks; the **generic progress-task tracker (§3.13)**; the full advancement loop (§3.15)
  incl. gates and invented abilities (§3.14a); local combat tracker wired to the dice
  engine — attacking from a combatant card and applying damage back to it, with no manual
  re-entry of numbers the app already knows.
- **Phase 5 — Multiplayer & Sync** *(gated per §1.1)*: Firebase, security rules
  (incl. group-entity write rules), anonymous auth + Google link, campaigns/join codes,
  party overview, shared pools, shared combat with two-way sync, shared tasks + roll log,
  portraits, PWA update toast.
- **Phase 6+ — Conditional surfaces:** expansion toggles per commitment tier; solo mode
  (with its procedural framing, §3.20 — not just its tables); GM screen (party panel, peek
  sheets, drop-in combatants, hand out damage/conditions, rollable §3.21 reference tables,
  and the book's own "how to build one" guidance); power-automation engine; advanced
  automation behind one shared toggle.
- **Hardening (always):** the harnesses of §11.1, the accessibility pass, the §6.2–§6.7
  layout, flow and teaching rules, and the **audit protocol of §11 run to a clean pass**.

**Per-feature spec format (mandatory for every roadmap item):**
- **Rule:** the canonical mechanic with exact numbers (cited to the source).
- **Target:** file · module · function.
- **Behavior/UI:** what to build and where it appears — including *where on the screen*
  relative to §6.2–§6.5, and the `explain()` line it carries (§6.6).
- **Schema:** new fields — name · type · default · location (and §7 updated).
- **Acceptance:** how to confirm it works in a browser, and which harness check pins it.

---

## 10. Process rules — **LOCKED**

1. **Living spec.** The project CLAUDE.md is canonical. **Every code change updates it in
   the same change** — features, data model, file tables, roadmap checkboxes, ledger
   ticks, changelog. A code change with a stale CLAUDE.md is incomplete.
2. **Single source of truth.** All rules data and numbers live in the `data*.js` files.
   Never hardcode a rules value in a `src/` module — if a table is missing, add it to the
   data layer first (and to the ledger if it was missed).
3. **Changelog table.** Every change appends a dated row: what, why, root cause for
   fixes, verification performed, cache version.
4. **Verify in a real browser.** Every phase/feature is verified headless (Playwright,
   Firebase requests aborted) before being marked complete: the flow works end-to-end
   with **zero console errors**. "Syntax is valid" is not verification.
5. **Committed regression harness.** See §11.1 for the required checks. Every bug fix adds
   a check that would catch its return.
6. **Prove the guard bites.** A regression check written after a fix is worthless until you
   have seen it fail. Reintroduce the defect, watch the check go red, restore the fix. Two
   guards in the reference build passed happily against the bug they were written for —
   one matched on the wrong whitespace, one ran in a state where the bug could not occur.
7. **Cache discipline.** Any shipped-file change bumps `CACHE_VERSION`.
8. **Root-cause fixes.** Debug to the actual cause before editing; record cause + fix in
   the changelog. No symptom-patching.
9. **Scope guard.** Core rules (+ toggled supplied expansions) only. No setting/adventure
   content. Nothing invented presented as official — any house convenience is explicitly
   labeled a house aid (§2.2).
10. **Module discipline.** Respect §6.1 responsibilities; export/import explicitly; split
    a module that outgrows its job along the same lines.
11. **One record, not two.** When two surfaces generate the same kind of thing (a GM
    building an adventure site and a solo player generating one), they share **one record
    shape, one builder and one renderer**, with a migration folding any legacy shape in.
    Two shapes for one concept is a bug with a delayed fuse.
12. **Counters live in one place.** A count that drives a procedure (which countdown step
    is next, how many rolls a talent has left) is stored once and read by every path. Two
    paths deriving the same count from different sources will disagree, and capped history
    lists cannot be counted at all.

### 10.1 Authoring rules that prevent §0

The audit protocol *finds* inert rules. These four stop you writing them. In the reference
build they would have prevented roughly half of eighty-five findings.

13. **Explain and enforce, in the same change.** The moment you write UI copy that states
    a mechanic — a blurb under a toggle, a line in a modal, a sentence on a card — you owe
    one of two things in that same change: **the engine enforcing it**, or the copy
    explicitly marked as guidance the app does not automate. Never a third option. Almost
    every inert rule in the reference build began as an honest sentence describing
    something nothing did: *"Reacting costs them their next turn"* appeared in three
    dialogs and was enforced in none. Grep your own copy for imperative rule language
    ("costs", "may not", "must", "instead of", "each", "per") and check each hit has an
    enforcer.
14. **Every flag has a setter, a reader and a clearer.** A boolean or counter on state is
    not done when it is written. Name all three call sites in the same change: what sets
    it, what reads it, and **what clears it** — usually normalization or the lifecycle
    engine. Two reference-build flags were written and read nowhere; two more were set and
    never cleared, so a condition became permanent. If you cannot name the clearer, the
    flag is a leak.
15. **Defaults follow the fiction.** When a rule applies unless something prevents it, its
    control **defaults to on**. A dice penalty for wearing a helmet, shipped defaulting to
    off, is a rule that will never once apply in play. Ask of every toggle: what happens if
    the player never touches this — is that the game's default state or the opposite of it?
16. **One lookup per kind of thing.** Everything that can stand opposite the party — major
    threats, minor NPCs, animals — resolves through **one function**, not one per data
    file. The moment a second list exists, one surface will know about it and three will
    not, and the ones that do not will silently fall back to a guessed value. The same
    applies to abilities: one resolver that also sees character-owned entries (§3.14a).
17. **A shape change ships a migration and a fixture.** Any change to a stored shape adds
    the migration **and** a test that loads a hand-written old-shape record and asserts the
    new one comes out right. Migrations that were never run against real old data are
    hopes, not code.
18. **Reversibility is inventoried.** List every action that destroys state. Each one either
    undoes (a snapshot the user can revert) or confirms while naming the loss (§6.4).
    Reference builds ship with undo on the lifecycle engine and nothing else, and the
    unprotected actions are exactly the ones taken at the end of a tense scene.

## 11. Audit protocol — mandatory before "done"

One audit pass is not enough. In the reference build, **eleven passes** were required, and
the last four still found real defects — including four screens whose primary action was
off-screen and a rule that had been inert since Phase 3. Run the passes below in order,
repeat the cycle until a full cycle produces nothing, and record everything in
`docs/AUDIT.md` as numbered findings (**Rule / Target / Fix / Why it mattered**) plus a
**verified-clean list** so later passes do not re-litigate settled ground.

### 11.1 The three harnesses — build these first

**A. Unit + data harness (`npm test`, seconds).**
- **Parses every source file first.** `node --check` each `src/*.js` and `data*.js`, and
  fail by filename. A missing paren in a screen module does not throw in the browser — it
  presents as a screen that never renders and a test run that hangs. This check costs one
  second and saves an hour.
- §3.5 derivation invariants across generated + pregen characters (and the errata list).
- Dice-engine invariants: the §3.2 opposed sequence, §3.3 caps and decay, push legality,
  the death procedure's terminal states.
- Table completeness: every D66/D100 table has its full row count and unique rows; every
  range table covers its range.
- Every closed audit finding.

**B. Browser smoke (Playwright, ~1 minute).** Boots the app and asserts:
- Every route renders a heading with zero console errors.
- Zero horizontal overflow at 320/360/390px.
- **No stray `null`/`undefined`/`NaN`/`[object Object]` text node** anywhere on any route.
- Nothing at the foot of a screen sits under the fixed tab bar (skipping controls inside
  collapsed panels — they keep their last layout position and read as buried while being
  unreachable).
- **Each screen's primary action is above the fold without scrolling** (§6.3.2).
- Section nav reaches every sibling route and marks the current one; live-state badges
  appear only when the state is live.
- No checkbox has an effective tap target under 40px (measure the wrapping label).
- The end-to-end walk: wizard → sheet → roll → push → damage → condition → log.

**C. Interaction audit (Playwright, ~1 minute).** Visits every route and **clicks every
visible control in isolation** — resetting storage and re-rendering between clicks — and
flags three things: a JS error, a control that cannot be clicked, and a control that
changes **nothing** (no re-render, no modal, no toast, no storage write, no navigation).
The no-op check is what catches a button wired to a handler that returns early.
**Poll for the change rather than waiting a fixed interval**; a fixed wait loses the race
with a handler that opens a modal and manufactures findings that reproduce nowhere.

### 11.2 Pass types — run all of them, in this order

1. **Dead-data scan (mechanical).** Two scripts: *every export nothing else imports*, and
   *every named import a file never uses*. Triage each hit: provenance constant (fine),
   redundant duplicate (delete or note), or **a rule the engine never reads** (a finding).
   This pass alone produced 22 findings in one reference cycle. Run it first, every cycle.
2. **Rules-file read-through.** Read the distilled `docs/rules/*.md` section by section
   against the engine, asking of each sentence: *where does this happen in code?* This
   catches what the scans cannot — rules that are implemented but implemented wrongly, and
   rules never extracted in the first place. Where the rules file and the source disagree,
   **the source wins and the rules file is corrected** — and where a distilled file and the
   data file disagree, check the source before assuming the code is wrong.
3. **Ability sweep.** List every ability whose effect is `rule` rather than `dice` (§3.14a)
   and find each one's home in the engine. Anything without a home is inert.
4. **Interaction audit** (harness C).
5. **Measured layout.** A probe seeds a realistic mid-session state and records, per route:
   document height in viewports, control count, **the scroll offset of the primary action**,
   and every tap target's effective size. Read the table, not the screens. Four buried
   primary actions survived ten passes of reading and fell out of one table.
6. **Stress state.** Re-run the probe with what a table actually accumulates by session
   three: a full party, several conditions and a full pack each, ten combatants, a spent
   pacing deck, a full roll log, several adventure sites. Screens that are fine empty
   buckle here — a hundred log entries is fifteen phone screens.
7. **Flow walk.** Play a whole session through the app and ask at each step: *what do I tap
   next, and how many taps is it?* Look specifically for terminal states with no onward
   route (§6.3.6), procedures that require remembering a screen, and state that is invisible
   from where you need it.

### 11.3 Where the findings actually are

- **Data values audit essentially clean.** Spot-check every category; fully check every
  formula and every creation table; then stop looking there.
- **Engine behaviour is where the bugs live** — gating, options, limits and sequencing:
  push legality, rest once-per-X, crit option choices, multi-attack counts, the exact
  opposed sequence including ties and resource banking, currency caps and decay, once-per-
  scene escape hatches, lifecycle bundles, one-advance-per-X gates, and **every rule that
  costs a turn** (reactions, freezing, stuns) — that last category is written as prose in
  three places and enforced in none, over and over.
- **Subsystem seams concentrate bugs.** The places where two modules meet — tracker and
  roller, solo and GM, sheet and lifecycle — are where state gets described instead of
  shared, where a value gets re-typed instead of read, and where two shapes of one record
  appear. When a pass is short of leads, walk the seams: for each pair of modules that
  touch the same entity, ask what each one knows that the other should.
- **Re-verification method:** pull the app's value from the data files, query the source
  for the canonical value, compare; corroborate surprising answers before editing.

### 11.4 Cadence — what to run, and when

Passes are not equally expensive. Run them at the frequency their cost justifies:

| Pass | Cost | Run it |
|---|---|---|
| Parse gate + unit harness | seconds | every change |
| Dead-data scan (§11.2.1) | seconds | every change that adds data or a rule |
| Browser smoke | ~1 min | before every commit |
| Interaction audit | ~1 min | end of every feature |
| Rules read-through (§11.2.2) | hours | end of every phase, and every audit cycle |
| Measured layout / stress (§11.2.5–6) | ~10 min | end of every phase, after any layout change |
| Flow walk (§11.2.7) | ~30 min | end of every phase, and before calling it done |

**The stopping rule:** the build is done when **one complete cycle of all seven passes
produces no finding**. Not when a pass is clean — the reference build had clean passes at
six, eight and ten, and the next cycle found eleven, four and eight things respectively.
A cycle that produces only cosmetic findings is still a cycle that produced findings.

**When a pass finds nothing, suspect the pass.** Two consecutive empty passes of the same
type usually means the method has stopped reaching new ground, not that the ground is
clean — change the seed state, change the width, change the order you read in. The most
productive passes in the reference build came from changing the *method*: from reading to
scanning, from scanning to measuring, from measuring at zero state to measuring under load.

## 12. Content & IP rules

- Extract **numbers and mechanics**; **paraphrase all effect/flavor text concisely —
  never copy rules prose verbatim.** No setting, adventure, art, or logo content.
- House aids are labelled as such in the UI and isolated in their own files (§2.2).
- The generated app is a **personal play aid** built from the user's own books. State in
  the README that if the user publishes or distributes it, licensing is their
  responsibility, and that openly licensed material (an SRD, ORC/CC content) is the safe
  basis for anything public. If the source is a transcription of a commercial book, the
  repository stays private.

## 13. Known defect classes — check for each by name

Every one of these shipped in a reference build and was caught late. Grep for your own
version of each before declaring a phase done.

| | Defect | How it hides | The check |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | `node.append(x)` where `x` can be null renders the text `null` | Only in the state where the value is absent | Text-node scan (§11.1 B) |
| D-2 | A toggle sets a flag nothing reads (full auto, ambush, a stance) | The UI describes the rule perfectly | Dead-data scan; grep the flag |
| D-3 | A `rule`-kind ability is displayed and never fires | It appears on the sheet | Ability sweep (§11.2.3) |
| D-4 | A state field is written and never read (`frozen`, `stunned`) | Nothing visibly breaks | Dead-data scan |
| D-5 | Two counters for one procedure disagree | Only after both paths are used | One-record rule (§10.12) |
| D-6 | A degradable resource has no repair path | Nobody degrades it in testing | Flow walk |
| D-7 | A terminal outcome offers no next step | The modal reads as complete | Flow walk (§6.3.6) |
| D-8 | The primary action is below the fold | You always scroll during development | Measured layout (§11.2.5) |
| D-9 | A list grows without bound | Fine with three entries | Stress state (§11.2.6) |
| D-10 | An inline style overrides the stylesheet (13px checkboxes) | Looks deliberate | Tap-target measurement |
| D-11 | A wrapping value straddles its label in a flex row | Only with long text | Definition rows (§6.5) |
| D-12 | An archetype exception is not branched on everywhere | The common path works | §3.10a checklist |
| D-13 | Two surfaces generate the same record in two shapes | Each works alone | One-record rule (§10.11) |
| D-14 | A guard passes against the bug it was written for | Green is reassuring | Prove it bites (§10.6) |
| D-15 | A fixed wait in a harness manufactures a finding | Fails once in ten runs | Poll, don't wait |
| D-16 | A cascade rule ("roll again", "fire again") implemented as a single shot | The first roll works | Grep the source for repetition language (§3.1) |
| D-17 | A flag is set and never cleared, so a condition becomes permanent | Only on the second occurrence | Setter/reader/clearer rule (§10.14) |
| D-18 | A default-off control for a rule that applies by default | The rule simply never fires | Defaults follow the fiction (§10.15) |
| D-19 | Two modules describe the same state instead of sharing it | Each works in isolation | Seam walk (§11.3) |
| D-20 | A rule in an appendix, sidebar or stat block is never extracted | The chapter sweep looked complete | Read boxed text (§2) |
| D-21 | A destructive action has neither undo nor confirmation | Nobody does it during testing | Reversibility inventory (§10.18) |
| D-22 | A permission the book grants has no control | It reads as flavour | Permissions are features (§2) |
| D-23 | A lookup exists per data file instead of per concept | The main list works | One lookup per kind (§10.16) |

## 14. Kickoff Prompt — copy-paste this to start a project

> Copy the block below into a fresh chat along with this template file and (if available)
> the rulebook source. It is kept in sync with this template by design — if you edit one,
> edit the other.

```
Role: You are an Expert Software Architect and AI Project Manager.

Context: I am providing "RPG Player-Character App — Autonomous Build Instructions" (v3),
which defines a four-stage execution order (A: Ingest & Extract, B: Checkpoint + Product
Q&A, C: Autonomous Build, D: Audit to done) for building an installable HTML5/vanilla-JS
RPG companion app.

Objective: Guide me through Stage A and Stage B so we generate the project's canonical
CLAUDE.md — the completed System Profile, the content inventory, the T-numbered Data
Extraction Ledger, my recorded product decisions, and the phased build roadmap — before
any development begins.

Rules & Constraints:
1. No application code until I sign off Stage B. Producing the CLAUDE.md itself is the
   deliverable of this phase.
2. Source first: your FIRST question is to confirm the rulebook source. If a queryable or
   readable source exists (NotebookLM notebook, PDFs, SRD), extract the System Profile
   from it autonomously — map the table of contents first, extract section by section,
   and corroborate every surprising value with a second, differently-phrased query. For
   sequential procedures (opposed tests, death, extended tasks, lifecycle boundaries),
   get the EXACT step-by-step rule including ties and edge cases — never a summary.
3. Watch for corrupted tables. If the source is a transcription, multi-column tables are
   probably de-interleaved and unrecoverable. Do not reconstruct them — list them at the
   checkpoint and ask me for a photo of those pages.
4. Bring questions to me only for: (a) genuine rules ambiguities, each with your proposed
   ruling; (b) the standard Stage B product-decision questions (usage mode, my seat at
   the table, dice input, expansion commitment tiers, table device, theme default).
   If NO digital source exists, instead interview me through the §3 System Profile
   slot by slot.
5. Strictly one question at a time. Wait for my answer before the next. Never a list.
6. No assumptions: never substitute training-data memory of the game for the source. A
   missing value gets queried, then asked, then marked blocked — never guessed.
7. Every ledger row names the module that will consume the table. A table with no
   consumer is a table that will be extracted and never called.
8. On Stage B sign-off, write the project CLAUDE.md per §9 of the instructions —
   including the Data Extraction Ledger with every box unticked — then stop and await my
   go-ahead for Stage C.

Next Steps: Acknowledge these constraints, then ask your first question (the rulebook
source).
```

## Template changelog

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| v3 | 2026-08-13 | Lessons from the Electric State reference build (eleven audit passes). New §0 naming the dominant defect class (data extracted, never called) and §11.2's mechanical dead-data scan that finds it. New §2.1 source precedence + de-interleaved tables + printed-value errata; §2.2 house-aid rules. New §3 slots: 3.3a currency lose-conditions, 3.10a archetype damage exceptions, 3.14a rule-kind abilities, 3.22 safety tools; sharpened 3.9 (rule-rewriting conditions + conflict order), 3.12 (environmental checks), 3.17 (reaction costs, dual scales), 3.20 (solo procedural framing). New §6.2 screen anatomy (the fixed frame, sticky resource header, colour semantics, zoom lock); §6.3 placing controls for gameplay flow (two-level nav, pinned action bar, controls ordered by the sequence of play, frequency decides height, in-scene before between-scene, screens that lead somewhere, the named next step, travelling live state, tap targets); §6.4 feedback and dialogs (toast vs modal vs inline, results that show their working, confirmations that name the loss, refusals that cite the rule); §6.5 density under load; §6.6 the four teaching layers (per-screen explain note, rules-library links, the tutorial, in-context teaching); §6.7 the measurement contract the harness enforces — each rule a measured defect from this build. §9.1 ledger rows now name their consuming module. §10 adds prove-the-guard-bites, one-record and one-counter rules. §11 rewritten as a repeatable multi-pass protocol with three specified harnesses (incl. the parse gate and the interaction audit) and a statement of where findings actually are. New §9.1a Rules Traceability Ledger (rule → data → engine → surface → test, filled while building, gaps visible before they ship). New §10.1 authoring rules that prevent the §0 defect rather than finding it later: explain-and-enforce in the same change, every flag has a setter/reader/clearer, defaults follow the fiction, one lookup per kind of thing, shape changes ship a migration fixture, reversibility is inventoried. New §11.4 cadence table and the stopping rule (a full seven-pass cycle with no finding — clean single passes at six, eight and ten were each followed by cycles finding eleven, four and eight), plus subsystem seams as a lead when a pass runs dry. Extraction rules for appendix/sidebar rules and for permissions the book grants. Cascade rules flagged in §3.1. Voice rule: the app uses the book's own state names. §13 grown to twenty-three named defect classes. |
| v2 | 2026-07-06 | Lessons from the Dune: Adventures in the Imperium reference build: new §3 slots (opposed-test sequence 3.2, meta-currencies 3.3, group entity 3.8, scene/session lifecycle 3.12, extended/progress tasks 3.13); mandatory Data Extraction Ledger (§9.1); Stage B split into checkpoint + standard product Q&A (§4.2); local-first default with First Session Playable milestone gating Phase 5; mandatory roll log, JSON export/import, persistent resource header, lifecycle confirm+undo, rules-citation links; notebook extraction warning about summarized procedures; kickoff prompt embedded (§13). |
| v1 | — | Original template from the first reference implementation. |
